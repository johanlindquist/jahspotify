Jah'Spotify Project
===============================================================================

---- Introduction -----

Jah'Spotify is a simple Java wrapper built on top of the Spotify native APIs (libspotify)

Currently supports:

- retrieving library (all user playlists)
- retrieve a playlist
- retrieve an album
- retrieve a track
- retrieve an image
- add tracks to a queue
- play tracks
- pause/skip/play functions

All the above functions are accessible over a JSON based RESTful API.  This is very much work in progress and will
most likely change over time.

---- To build -----

Currently, Jah'Spotify only supports the Linux version of libspotify and will therefore require a Linux installation
to compile.  You also need to download and install libspotify & request an API key from Spotify.  This can be done
on the http://developer.spotify.com website.  Generate the key and download the C code version of it.  Place this
in a file called AppKey.h in the native/src/main/native/inc directory.  You may want to place some #ifndef APPKEY
statements in this to prevent linking problems.

Next, to build the sources, check 'em out from git

git clone git://github.com/johanlindquist/jahspotify.git
cd jahspotify
mvn clean install

---- Modules -----

- api: provides the basic operations for interacting with Jah'Spotify (and in turn libspotify)
- native: contains all native & JNI code interacting with libspotify
- web: provides the RESTful API (json based)
- web-client: provides java client for interacting with the RESTful API
- web-common: provides the java beans which are serialized over the RESTful API

---- REST API -----
